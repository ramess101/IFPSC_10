The viscosity at low pressures (< 0.2 MPa) has an expanded uncertainty
 (at 95% confidence) of 0.5% for 273 < T < 625 K.
 The uncertainty is 1.5% for the vapor phase at subcritical temperatures T = 273 K
 as well as in the supercritical thermodynamic region T = 423 K at pressures
 up to 30 MPa. For additional information on uncertainty consult the referenced manuscript.
