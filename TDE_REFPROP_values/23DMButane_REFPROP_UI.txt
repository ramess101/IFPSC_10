VISCOSITY
 The ECS parameters for viscosity were based on the data of:
 Wen, C., Meng, X., Wei, K., and Wu, J., "Compressed Liquid Viscosity of 2-Methylpentane, 3-Methylpentane, and 2,3-Dimethylbutane at Temperatures from (273 to 343) K and Pressures up to 40 MPa,"
 J. Chem. Eng. Data, 62:1146-1152, 2017.

Estimated uncertainty for liquid from 273-343 K at pressures to 100 MPa is 5%, vapor phase 10%.

Validity Range at Saturation:
150-500 K

Validity Range at T=293 K:
0-240 MPa
