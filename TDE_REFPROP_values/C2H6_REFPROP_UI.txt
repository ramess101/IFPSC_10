The viscosity in the limit of zero density has an expanded uncertainty (at 95% confidence)
 of 0.5% for 290 <T <625 K, increasing to 1% at temperatures down to 212 K.
 The uncertainty is 1.5% for 290 <T <430 K at pressures to 30 MPa. For additional
 information on uncertainty consult the referenced manuscript.


Validity Range at Saturation:
95-305 K


Validity Range at T=293 K:
0-560 MPa
