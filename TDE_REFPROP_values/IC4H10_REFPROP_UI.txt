 "Viscosity Correlation for Isobutane over Wide Ranges of the Fluid Region,"
 Int. J. Thermophys, 21(2):343-356, 2000.

The uncertainty in viscosity varies from 0.4% in the dilute gas between
 room temperature and 600 K, to 3.0% over the rest of the fluid surface.

Validity Range at Saturation:
115-390 K

Validity Range at T=293 K:
0-200 MPa; 200-400 MPa Extrapolation
