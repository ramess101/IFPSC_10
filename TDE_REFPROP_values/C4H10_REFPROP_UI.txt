Extracted from the manuscript:
"The viscosity at low pressures p = 0.2 MPa is described
with an expanded uncertainty of 0.5% (coverage factor k = 2)
for temperatures 293 = T/K = 626. The expanded uncertainty
in the vapor phase at subcritical temperatures T = 298 K as 
well as in the supercritical thermodynamic region T = 448 K 
at pressures p = 30 MPa is estimated to be 1.5%. It is raised to 4.0% 
in regions where only less reliable primary data sets are available 
and to 6.0% in ranges without any primary data, but in which the 
equation of state is valid. A weakness of the reference equation of 
state in the near-critical region prevents estimation of the 
expanded uncertainty in this region."

Validity Range at Saturation:
135-425 K

Validity Range at T=293 K:
0-200 valid; 200-390 extrapolation
