VISCOSITY
 The ECS parameters for viscosity were based on the data of:
 Wen, C., Meng, X., Wei, K., and Wu, J., "Compressed Liquid Viscosity of 2-Methylpentane, 3-Methylpentane, and 2,3-Dimethylbutane at Temperatures from (273 to 343) K and Pressures up to 40 MPa,"
 J. Chem. Eng. Data, 62:1146-1152, 2017. doi: 10.1021/acs.jced.6b01024

Estimated uncertainty for liquid from 273-343 K at pressures to 40 MPa is 2%, vapor phase is 10%. No vapor data available for comparison.


Validity range at saturation:
120-500 K

Validity range at T=293:
0-430 MPa
