The estimated uncertainty in viscosity is 0.5% along the saturated liquid line,
 2% in compressed liquid to 200 MPa, 5% in vapor and supercritical regions.

DATA SOURCES FOR VISCOSITY
 The parameters for viscosity were based in part on the data of:
 Knapstad, B., Skjolsvik, P.A., Oye, H.A., "Viscosity of Three Binary Hydrocarbon Mixtures," J. Chem. Eng. Data, 36:84-88, 1991.
 Dymond, J.H., Young, K.J., "Transport Properties of Nonelectrolyte Liquid Mixtures- I. Viscosity Coefficients for n-Alkane Mixtures at Saturation Pressure from 283 to 378 K," Int. J. Thermophys., 1(4):331-344, 1980.
 Caudwell, D.R., "Viscosity measurements on dense fluid mixtures, PhD Thesis, Imperial College, London, UK, 2004.
 Lyusternik, V.E. and Zhdanov, A.G., Teplofiz. Svoistva Veshchestv Mater, No.7, Rabinovich, V.A. ed., Standards Publishing, Moscow, 1973.
 Average absolute deviations of the fit from the experimental data are:
 Knapstad: avg 0.20% (max 0.37); Dymond avg. 0.27% (max 0.45);
 Caudwell: avg 0.59% (max 2.71); Lyusternik: 1.07% (max -1.85).
