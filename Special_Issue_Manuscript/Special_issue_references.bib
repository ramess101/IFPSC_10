   abstract = {We propose {Lennard-Jones} potential parameters for interatomic interactions of linear and branched alkanes based on matching the results of Gibbs ensemble simulations of vapor-liquid equilibria to experimental data. The alkane model is similar as in the OPLS-AA [W. L. Jorgensen, D. S. Maxwell, and J. Tirado-Rives, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 11225 (1996)], but multiple atom types for carbon based on the number of covalently bonded hydrogen atoms are necessary to accurately reproduce liquid densities and enthalpies of vaporization with the errors of 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively, for hydrocarbons of various chain lengths and structures. We find that the attraction energies of the carbon atoms are almost proportional to the number of covalent hydrogen atoms with each increasing the carbon energy parameter by approximate to0.033 kcal/mol. Though the present force field outperforms the OPLS-AA force field for alkanes we studied, systematic deviations for vapor pressures are still observed with errors of 15%-30%, and critical temperatures are slightly underestimated. We think that these shortcomings are probably due to the inadequacy of the two-parameter {Lennard-Jones} potential, and especially its behavior at short distances.

Such simulations comprise two simulation boxes and require a transfer of volume and particles between them. Generally, trial moves are proposed at random from a uniform distribution. In this work, we propose a hybrid configurational bias method where trial moves, including particle transfers, are proposed by resorting to molecular-dynamics techniques. Suitable acceptance/rejection criteria are subsequently applied to ensure appropriate sampling of the relevant statistical-mechanical ensembles. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by presenting results of phase equilibrium simulations for systems of long chain molecules.},

   abstract = {Since the seminal paper by Panagiotopoulos [Mol. Phys. 61, 813 (1997)], the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method has been the most popular particle-based simulation approach for the computation of vapor-liquid phase equilibria. However, the validity of GEMC simulations in the near-critical region has been questioned because rigorous finite-size scaling approaches cannot be applied to simulations with fluctuating volume. Valleau [Mol. Simul. 29, 627 (2003)] has argued that GEMC simulations would lead to a spurious overestimation of the critical temperature. More recently, Patel et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 134, 024101 (2011)] opined that the use of analytical tail corrections would be problematic in the near-critical region. To address these issues, we perform extensive GEMC simulations for {Lennard-Jones} particles in the near-critical region varying the system size, the overall system density, and the cutoff distance. For a system with N = 5500 particles, potential truncation at 8s and analytical tail corrections, an extrapolation of GEMC simulation data at temperatures in the range from 1.27 to 1.305 yields T-c = 1.3128 +/- 0.0016, rho(c) = 0.316 +/- 0.004, and p(c) = 0.1274 +/- 0.0013 in excellent agreement with the thermodynamic limit determined by Potoff and Panagiotopoulos [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 10914 (1998)] using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. Critical properties estimated using GEMC simulations with different overall system densities (0.296 <= rho(t) <= 0.336) agree to within the statistical uncertainties. For simulations with tail corrections, data obtained using r(cut) = 3.5s yield Tc and pc that are higher by 0.2% and 1.4% than simulations with r(cut) <= 5 and 8 sigma but still with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. In contrast, GEMC simulations with a truncated and shifted potential show that r(cut) = 8 sigma is insufficient to obtain accurate results. Additional GEMC simulations for hard-core square-well particles with various ranges of the attractive well and for n-decane molecules represented by the TraPPE force field yield data that support the trends observed for {Lennard-Jones} particles. The finite-size dependence of the critical properties obtained from GEMC simulations is significantly smaller than those from grand-canonical ensemble simulations. Thus, when resources are not available for a rigorous finite-size scaling study, GEMC simulations provide a straightforward route to determine fairly accurate critical properties using relatively small system sizes.

   abstract = {A new model for the n-alkane homologous series has been developed, parametrized to the vapor-liquid coexistence properties for a range of chain lengths. The model utilizes the Buckingham exponential-6 potential to describe the nonbonded interaction energy. Histogram reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo methods were used to determine the model parameters. The new model reproduces the experimental saturated liquid and vapor densities and vapor pressures for ethane through octane to within average absolute deviations of 0.5%, 2.1%, and 2.2% respectively. Critical temperatures and densities were also found to be in good agreement with experiment. Critical pressures are slightly overestimated for longer chain lengths. Comparisons were made to the TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 2569.] and NERD [J. Chern. Phys. 1998, 108, 9905.] models. The two previous models reproduce the liquid properties with comparable accuracy to the proposed model; however, the new model was found to describe the vapor pressures more accurately. Liquid densities were determined for the new model for chain lengths as long as C-78 Agreement to experiment is within 1% at atmospheric pressure. Phase diagrams were calculated for mixtures of ethane-heptane, ethane-decane, ethane-eicosane, and octane-dodecane. The new model achieves near-experimental predictive accuracy for these mixtures.},

 abstract = {The statistical properties of the approximate confidence regions for nonlinear estimation based on the likelihood ratio criterion are considered, assuming normal variation of errors. It is suggested that these approximate confidence regions are preferable to any known exact confidence regions for this problem, provided that the model is only moderately non-linear. A numerical measure of the non-linearity of a model (as a function of the experimental design and the parameter values) is proposed. This can be used to indicate: (a) the accuracy of these approximate confidence regions, and a simple method of modifying the regions to avoid exaggerating the significance of the experimental data in doubtful cases; and (b) the effectiveness of a non-linear transformation of parameters as a device for making the model approximately linear. Methods of computing the non-linearity so defined, either empirically or theoretically, are indicated.},

   abstract = {A new set of united-atom {Lennard-Jones} interaction parameters for n-alkanes is proposed from fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: OPLS [Jorgensen, et al. J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1984, 106, 813], SKS [Siepmann, et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and TraPPE. Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that an either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

   abstract = {A rigorous statistical analysis is presented for Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. This analysis reduces the uncertainty in the critical point estimate when compared with traditional methods found in the literature. Two different improvements are recommended due to the following results. First, the traditional propagation of error approach for estimating the standard deviations used in regression improperly weighs the terms in the objective function due to the inherent interdependence of the vapor and liquid densities. For this reason, an error model is developed to predict the standard deviations. Second, and most importantly, a rigorous algorithm for nonlinear regression is compared to the traditional approach of linearizing the equations and propagating the error in the slope and the intercept. The traditional regression approach can yield nonphysical confidence intervals for the critical constants. By contrast, the rigorous algorithm restricts the confidence regions to values that are physically sensible. To demonstrate the effect of these conclusions, a case study is performed to enhance the reliability of molecular simulations to resolve the n-alkane family trend for the critical temperature and critical density.

Despite significant recent progress in our ability to model phase equilibria in multicomponent mixtures from direct molecular simulations, the accurate determination of critical parameters remains a difficult problem. Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations with systems of controlled linear system size are used to obtain the phase behavior in the near-critical region for two- and three-dimensional {Lennard-Jones} fluids with reduced cutoff radii of 2, 2.5, and 5. For the two-dimensional systems, crossover of the effective exponent for the width of the coexistence curve from mean field (beta=1/2) in the immediate vicinity of the critical point to Ising-like (beta=1/8) farther away is observed. Critical parameters determined by fitting the data that follow Ising-like behavior are in good agreement with literature values obtained with finite-size scaling methods. For the three-dimensional systems, no crossover to mean field-type behavior was apparent. Extrapolated results for the critical parameters are consistent with literature estimates for similar fluids. For both two- and three-dimensional fluids, system size effects on the coexistence curves away from the critical point are small, normally within simulation statistical uncertainties.},

   abstract = {This paper examines the latest recommendations by Ambrose (on behalf of IUPAC) for the critical constants of normal alkanes, with the primary goal of extrapolating to very large normal alkanes such as linear polyethylene. The Flory theory has been modified slightly and applied to the correlation of the critical constants. The theory treats all three critical constants on an internally-consistent basis, which is a clear theoretical advance relative to previous work. Inclusion of the chain-length variation in the critical properties of normal alkanes makes it possible to establish the limiting values for critical temperature, pressure, and density. These limiting values are more credible than those predicted by ''power'' or ''exponential'' laws, which lack theoretical foundation and may be unsuitable for extrapolation.},

Some possible improvements of the Riedel model are examinated, and a simple modification which greatly improves the accuracy of the Riedel equation is proposed.  This modification is particularly suitable in the case of some strongly associated compounds, such as alcohols, and polyfunctional molecules, such as glycols.  The superiority of the Riedel model is discussed on the basis of the results obtained by predicting the vapor pressure curve of several nonpolar and polar compounds in a wide experimental range.  The performances of the Thodos and Riedel equations in the region of very low vapor pressures are emphasized.},

Rules are given for calculating the Z(RA) values for several classes of compounds, including strongly polar molecules.

This vapor pressure equation was based on the Wagner equation and is similar to that used by Ambrose. Literature vapor pressure measurements have been reviewed. Tables are given that list the type of apparatus, measurement range and precision, and chemical purity. These criteria were initially used to select measurements for inclusion in the regression analyses to determine the coefficients of the correlation, Vapor pressures estimated from the correlation were compared with all vapor pressure (p(1+g)) measurements reviewed in this work. At pressures greater than 1 kPa, the vapor pressure equation presented here has the following accuracies: 0.0001.p(1+g) for methane, 0.001.p(1+g) for ethane, propane, and n-butane, 0.002.p(1+g) for n-pentane through n-octane, 2-methylpropane, and 2-methylbutane, 0.005.p(1+g) for 2,2-dimethylpropane, n-nonane, n-decane, and the isomers of hexane through nonane, 0.01.p(1+g) for n-undecane to n-hexadecane, 0.02.p(1+g) for n-heptadecane to n-eicosane, 0.05.p(1+g) for n-heneicosane to n-octacosane, and 0.10.p(1+g) for n-nonacosane to n-hexatriacontane, Equations for the critical temperatures and pressures of the normal alkanes as functions of the carbon number are also reported.

abstract="A central goal of molecular simulations is to predict physical or chemical properties such that costly and elaborate experiments can be minimized. The reliable generation of molecular models is a critical issue to do so. Hence, striving for semiautomated and fully automated parameterization of entire force fields for molecular simulations, the authors developed several modular program packages in recent years. The programs run with limited user interactions and can be executed in parallel on modern computer clusters. Various interlinked resolutions of molecular modeling are addressed: For intramolecular interactions, a force-field optimization package named Wolf2Pack has been developed that transfers knowledge gained from quantum mechanics to Newtonian-based molecular models. For intermolecular interactions, especially Lennard--Jones parameters, a modular optimization toolkit of programs and scripts has been created combining global and local optimization algorithms. Global optimization is performed by a tool named CoSMoS, while local optimization is done by the gradient-based optimization workflow named GROW or by a derivative-free method called SpaGrOW. The overall goal of all program packages is to realize an easy, efficient, and user-friendly development of reliable force-field parameters in a reasonable time. The various tools are needed and interlinked since different stages of the optimization process demand different courses of action. In this paper, the conception of all programs involved is presented and how they communicate with each other.",

abstract={The {Lennard-Jones} (LJ) potential is a cornerstone of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and among the most widely used computational kernels in science. The LJ potential models atomistic attraction and repulsion with century old prescribed parameters (q = 6, p = 12, respectively), originally related by a factor of two for simplicity of calculations. We propose the inference of the repulsion exponent through Hierarchical Bayesian uncertainty quantification We use experimental data of the radial distribution function and dimer interaction energies from quantum mechanics simulations. We find that the repulsion exponent p [?] 6.5 provides an excellent fit for the experimental data of liquid argon, for a range of thermodynamic conditions, as well as for saturated argon vapour. Calibration using the quantum simulation data did not provide a good fit in these cases. However, values p [?] 12.7 obtained by dimer quantum simulations are preferred for the argon gas while lower values are promoted by experimental data. These results show that the proposed LJ 6-p potential applies to a wider range of thermodynamic conditions, than the classical LJ 6-12 potential. We suggest that calibration of the repulsive exponent in the LJ potential widens the range of applicability and accuracy of MD simulations.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of Buckingham (exp‐6) van der Waals potentials in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can quite successfully reproduce experimental thermodynamic data at low densities. However, they are less successful in producing a description of the repulsive regions of the potential energy surface (PES) that is in accord with the results of high‐level ab initio computations. We show that Morse potentials can be parameterized to give excellent fits to both the attractive and repulsive regions of the PES. The best set of alkane van der Waals Morse function parameters reported to date for the description of nonbond repulsive interactions is presented, as determined by comparison with both ab initio and experimental results. C…C, H…H and C…H atom‐pair potentials employing parameter sets based on the use of the geometric mean in the fitting procedure are found to be portable from methane to n‐butane. Fitting to a combination of methane dimer interaction energies and forces from ab initio calculations yields parameter sets whose performance is superior to those determined from the interaction energies alone. Used in MD simulations, our newly developed parameter sets predict thermodynamic functions that show better agreement with experiment than those based on parameter sets in common use. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for the selection of force fields in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The framework associates the variability of the optimal parameters of the MD potentials under different environmental conditions with the corresponding variability in experimental data. The high computational cost associated with the hierarchical Bayesian framework is reduced by orders of magnitude through a parallelized Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method combined with the Laplace Asymptotic Approximation. The suitability of the hierarchical approach is demonstrated by performing MD simulations with prescribed parameters to obtain data for transport coefficients under different conditions, which are then used to infer and evaluate the parameters of the MD model. We demonstrate the selection of MD models based on experimental data and verify that the hierarchical model can accurately quantify the uncertainty across experiments; improve the posterior probability density function estimation of the parameters, thus, improve predictions on future experiments; identify the most plausible force field to describe the underlying structure of a given dataset. The framework and associated software are applicable to a wide range of nanoscale simulations associated with experimental data with a hierarchical structure.},
